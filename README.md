# toasttimer
A timer application for Toastmasters.

# Origin Story
The genesis for this project was the discovery that there are no reasonably priced Toastmasters timers available. My club, [Golden Gate Toastmasters](https://www.goldengatetoastmasters.com), used to have a hardware device, but it evenutally broke. I did a quick search and found that our device would cost $600+ on Amazon!

There are cheaper options. For a mere $100 you can get this stoplight looking thing... timer _not_ included:

This led me to look for iOS apps that we might run on an iPad. Nothing came up! So, here I'm making a simple web app that can be run on an iPad, and configured as necessary.
